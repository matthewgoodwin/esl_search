Welcome, this application is designed to help individuals find or create linguistic services. The linguistics industry is huge, but it's also very disorganized. Thus, it can be very difficult for individuals to find qaulity services at reasonable rates. This project seeks to connect people with the linguistic services they need.

Services can include: basic conversation; interview prep; test/exam prep; speech prep; hobby/sport; translations; 1:1 tutoring; lectures; trade based activities; etc.


Create your own service; set your own schedule; set your own pricing!
Find a service; find an instructor; learn more!
This service seeks to shift power from massive corporations, to the individuals --consumers & instructors-- that fuel them.
